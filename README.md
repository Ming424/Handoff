Handoff - A React project for SOEN 357 (User Interface Design)

### Introduction
Handoff presents our solution for the buy-online-and-pickup-in-store (BOPS) methodology. This methodology is similar to conventional delivery services, but switches out product delivery with product pickup. This means the users retrieve their purchases from the store themselves, rather than have someone deliver it to them. Reducing delivery costs and company resources, users are now able to order online using the usual services and interfaces, with the newly added option to drop by the store to pick their orders up. They are able to assess when their product is ready and the time it will take to pick up their product, thereby ensuring quick and secure transactions, reduced wait times, and reduced human contact, something much sought out since the breakout of the pandemic.
